# Capstone-project-bike-use-data
EDA Project for bike use data

## Scenario
The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

## About Divvy
Divvy is Chicagoland’s bike share system across Chicago and Evanston. Divvy provides residents and visitors with a convenient, fun and affordable transportation option for getting around and exploring Chicago.

## Business Task:
Analyze and identify Divvy bikes used between annual members and casual riders for marketing strategy.

Note: any rider type different from member is considered casual

## The Data
The data is located on an AWS server where it is easily downloadable. It is organized by year and Fiscal Quarters.

In the following link you'll find Divvy's Historical trip data available for public use: Public data

Each trip is anonymized and includes:

-Trip start day and time

-Trip end day and time

-Trip start station

-Trip end station

-Rider type (Member, Single Ride, and Day Pass)

The data has been processed to remove trips taken by staff as they service and inspect the system; and any trips below 60 seconds in length (potentially false starts or users trying to re-dock a bike to ensure it was secure).

**Note:** This data is provided according to the Divvy Data License Agreement and released monthly.
